\section{Introduction}

The $k$-center clustering problem is a crucial optimization task in computational geometry and machine learning, commonly used in applications like facility location, data compression, and social network analysis. It involves selecting $k$ center points to minimize the maximum distance between any data point and its nearest center. In real-world scenarios, where data is dynamic and constantly evolving, traditional static clustering methods fall short. To address this, we propose a fully dynamic algorithm for $k$-center clustering that adapts to data insertions, deletions, and queries in real-time, maintaining a high-quality solution. Our approach leverages navigating nets, offering a $(2 + \varepsilon)$-approximation factor, while ensuring performance independent of $k$. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements in both solution quality and speed over existing state-of-the-art algorithms.
